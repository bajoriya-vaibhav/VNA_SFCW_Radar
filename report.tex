\section{Introduction}

In this report, I present my implementation of a target detection system using Stepped-Frequency Continuous-Wave (SFCW) radar principles with a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). For my experimental demonstration, I used the PocketVNA device connected to S-band antennas to create a functional radar system capable of detecting and localizing targets.

I chose SFCW radar because it offers distinct advantages over other radar technologies for target detection applications. Unlike pulse-based systems that require high peak power and complex hardware for precise timing, or FMCW systems that demand excellent linearity in frequency sweeping, SFCW radar distributes energy across time while maintaining precise frequency control at each step. This approach is particularly well-suited for implementation using commercial Vector Network Analyzers (VNAs), which are specifically designed for accurate magnitude and phase measurements across discrete frequencies.

\section{Theory of Stepped-Frequency Continuous-Wave (SFCW) Radar}

\subsection{Fundamental Principles and Signal Model}

SFCW radar operates by transmitting a sequence of $N$ discrete frequencies, spanning a total bandwidth $B$. Each frequency step represents a single narrowband continuous wave (CW) transmission, and collectively these steps synthesize a wideband operation.

The transmitted signal follows a linear frequency progression given by:
\begin{equation}
    f_n = f_0 + n \Delta f,\quad n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, N-1
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f_0$ represents the initial (lowest) frequency
    \item $N$ is the total number of frequency steps
    \item $\Delta f$ is the frequency step size, calculated as $\Delta f = \frac{B}{N-1}$
\end{itemize}

For my implementation, I transmit each frequency for a predetermined dwell time, during which I measure both amplitude and phase of the returned signal.

\subsection{Range Profile Extraction}

By analyzing the phase shifts across all frequency steps, I can construct a range profile. The range to a target manifests as a frequency-dependent phase shift in the received signal:

\begin{equation}
    \phi_n = \frac{4\pi f_n R}{c} = \frac{4\pi (f_0 + n\Delta f) R}{c}
\end{equation}

This creates a linear phase progression across frequency steps that is proportional to the target range. To extract the range information, I apply an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) to convert the frequency-domain responses into a time-domain (range-domain) representation:

\begin{equation}
    s(t) = \text{IFFT}\left\{ S(f_n) \right\}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Key Performance Parameters}

The performance of my SFCW radar system is characterized through several key metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Range Resolution} ($\Delta R$): The system's ability to distinguish between targets at similar ranges:
    \begin{equation}
        \Delta R = \frac{c}{2B}
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Maximum Unambiguous Range} ($R_{max}$): The maximum range that can be measured without ambiguity:
    \begin{equation}
        R_{max} = \frac{c}{2\Delta f}
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Processing Gain} ($G_p$): The improvement in signal-to-noise ratio achieved through coherent processing:
    \begin{equation}
        G_p = 10\log_{10}(N) \text{ dB}
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\section{Vector Network Analyzer Fundamentals}

\subsection{PocketVNA Hardware Overview}

For my experiments, I used the PocketVNA, a portable two-port vector network analyzer with the following specifications:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frequency Range}: 500 kHz to 4 GHz
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Range}: Up to -70 dB at 50 MHz and up to -40 dB at 4 GHz
    \item \textbf{Measurement Speed}: Approximately 10 ms per data point plus USB communication
    \item \textbf{Number of Frequency Steps}: From 1 to 10001 points
    \item \textbf{Frequency Resolution}: As fine as 1 Hz
    \item \textbf{Physical Dimensions}: 90 mm × 64 mm × 26 mm (3.5" × 2.5" × 1")
    \item \textbf{Power Consumption}: < 500 mA, typically 400 mA
\end{itemize}

This compact device enables a complete 2-port VNA capability, measuring S11, S21, S12, and S22 parameters simultaneously, making it ideal for my radar implementation.

\subsection{S-Parameters and Their Significance}

S-parameters (scattering parameters) are essential for characterizing high-frequency networks and components. In my target detection system, the most relevant S-parameters are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{S11}: The reflection coefficient measured at port 1, representing the ratio between the incident and reflected wave. In my radar application, S11 measurements indicate reflections from targets when operating in monostatic configuration.
    
    \item \textbf{S21}: The forward transmission coefficient from port 1 to port 2, representing how much of the signal transmitted from port 1 is received at port 2. I use this parameter for bistatic measurements.
\end{itemize}

The relationship between S-parameters and physical quantities can be expressed as:
\begin{align}
    S_{11} &= \frac{b_1}{a_1}|_{a_2=0} \\
    S_{21} &= \frac{b_2}{a_1}|_{a_2=0}
\end{align}

where $a_i$ represents the incident wave at port $i$ and $b_i$ represents the reflected/transmitted wave at port $i$.

For radar applications, I also utilize parameters derived from S-parameters:
\begin{align}
    \text{Return Loss (dB)} &= -20\log_{10}|S_{11}| \\
    \text{VSWR} &= \frac{1+|S_{11}|}{1-|S_{11}|}
\end{align}

These measurements help me characterize my antennas and ensure optimal power transfer in the system.

\section{Calibration Procedure}

\subsection{Calibration Theory and Importance}

Proper calibration is essential for accurate measurements with a VNA. In my system, calibration compensates for systematic errors, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Cable losses and phase shifts
    \item Connector mismatches
    \item Internal reflections in the VNA
    \item Cross-talk between ports
\end{itemize}

For one-port measurements (S11), I used a three-term error model:

\begin{equation}
    S_{11,measured} = \frac{e_{00} + \frac{e_{01}e_{10}S_{11,actual}}{1-e_{11}S_{11,actual}}}{1}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $e_{00}$ is the directivity error (signal leakage directly from source to receiver)
    \item $e_{11}$ is the source match error (reflections due to impedance mismatch)
    \item $e_{01}e_{10}$ is the reflection tracking error (frequency response variation)
\end{itemize}

By measuring known standards (Open, Short, Load), I determined these error terms and subsequently corrected the measurements of unknown targets.

\subsection{Calibration Steps Using PocketVNA}

I performed the following calibration steps using the PocketVNA software:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Selected "Calibration" from the toolbar in the PocketVNA software
    \item Set the frequency range to match my experiment parameters (1600-2500 MHz, 1001 steps)
    \item Selected "Port 1 Reflection" calibration type for S11 measurements
    \item Connected the Open standard to port 1 and performed the scan
    \item Connected the Short standard to port 1 and performed the scan
    \item Connected the Load standard to port 1 and performed the scan
    \item Saved the calibration file and applied it to subsequent measurements
\end{enumerate}

For two-port measurements (S21), I additionally performed a Through calibration by connecting a cable or Through standard between ports 1 and 2.

\subsection{Calibration Verification}

After calibration, I verified its effectiveness by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Measuring the calibration standards again and plotting them on a Smith chart
    \item Confirming that the Open standard appeared at the rightmost point of the Smith chart
    \item Confirming that the Short standard appeared at the leftmost point of the Smith chart
    \item Confirming that the Load standard appeared at the center of the Smith chart
    \item For two-port calibration, verifying that the Through standard gave approximately 0 dB insertion loss across the frequency band
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{Hardware Configuration}

My target detection system consisted of the following components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item PocketVNA: A portable 2-port vector network analyzer (500 kHz - 4 GHz)
    \item Two S-band antennas with operational frequency matching my selected band
    \item Coaxial cables with SMA connectors to connect the antennas to the VNA
    \item Calibration kit consisting of Open, Short, Load, and Through standards
    \item Test targets of various sizes and materials
    \item Computer with PocketVNA software for control and data acquisition
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Physical Layout}

I tested two configurations for my experimental setup:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Configuration 1 (Monostatic/Reflection mode)}: Single antenna connected to port 1, measuring S11
    \item \textbf{Configuration 2 (Bistatic/Transmission mode)}: Two antennas, one connected to port 1 and another to port 2, measuring S21
\end{itemize}

I placed targets at various ranges from the antenna(s) to verify detection capability and range resolution.

\subsection{SFCW Parameter Selection}

For my target detection experiment, I selected the following SFCW parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Start frequency ($f_0$): 1600 MHz
    \item Stop frequency ($f_N$): 2500 MHz
    \item Number of steps ($N$): 1001
    \item Step size ($\Delta f$): 0.9 MHz
    \item Synthetic bandwidth ($B$): 900 MHz
\end{itemize}

These parameters provided a theoretical range resolution of approximately:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta R = \frac{c}{2B} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{2 \times 9 \times 10^8} = 0.167 \text{ meters} = 16.7 \text{ cm}
\end{equation}

The maximum unambiguous range was:
\begin{equation}
    R_{max} = \frac{c}{2\Delta f} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{2 \times 0.9 \times 10^6} = 166.7 \text{ meters}
\end{equation}

\section{Signal Processing Workflow}

\subsection{Data Acquisition Pipeline}

I performed data acquisition using the PocketVNA software following these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Configured the frequency sweep parameters (1600-2500 MHz, 1001 points)
    \item Applied calibration to ensure accurate measurements
    \item Collected complex S-parameter data (magnitude and phase) at each frequency point
    \item Exported the data for further processing in MATLAB
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Signal Processing Chain}

My signal processing workflow consisted of the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Frequency-Domain Windowing}: I applied a Kaiser window with $\beta = 6$ to reduce sidelobes in the range profile while preserving reasonable resolution.
    \item \textbf{Zero-Padding}: I extended the frequency-domain data with zeros to increase the number of points to 4096 for finer range resolution in the IFFT output.
    \item \textbf{IFFT Transformation}: I applied the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform to convert from frequency domain to time/range domain.
    \item \textbf{Range Calculation}: I converted the time axis to distance using the propagation velocity in the medium.
    \item \textbf{Background Subtraction}: I subtracted the response of an empty scene to enhance target detection.
    \item \textbf{Range Profile Analysis}: I identified peaks in the range profile corresponding to targets.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Target Detection Algorithm}

For target detection, I implemented a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector. The CA-CFAR (Cell Averaging CFAR) algorithm computes the detection threshold as:

\begin{equation}
T_{\text{CFAR}}(m) = \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{N_{\text{ref}}} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{R}} |s(m+i)|^2
\end{equation}

where $s(m)$ represents the signal at range bin $m$, $\mathcal{R}$ denotes the reference cells surrounding the cell under test (excluding guard cells), $N_{\text{ref}}$ is the number of reference cells, and $\alpha$ is a scaling factor determined by the desired false alarm probability.

\section{Experimental Results}

\subsection{Range Resolution Verification}

To verify my system's range resolution, I placed two identical metal targets at varying distances from each other and determined the minimum distinguishable separation. I found that the practical range resolution was approximately 18 cm, which closely matches the theoretical prediction of 16.7 cm.

\subsection{Effect of Windowing on Range Profile}

I compared different windowing functions to assess their impact on range profile quality. The results are summarized in the table below:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Window Function} & \textbf{Peak Sidelobe Level (dB)} & \textbf{3dB Resolution Width} \\
\hline
Rectangle (No window) & -13.3 & 1.00 (relative) \\
Hamming ($\alpha = 0.54$) & -42.7 & 1.30 \\
Hanning & -31.5 & 1.44 \\
Kaiser ($\beta = 3$) & -25.7 & 1.02 \\
Kaiser ($\beta = 6$) & -44.1 & 1.22 \\
Kaiser ($\beta = 13$) & -90.0 & 1.75 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of window functions and their effect on range profiles}
\end{table}

I selected the Kaiser window with $\beta = 6$ for my implementation as it provided the best balance between sidelobe reduction and range resolution preservation.

\subsection{Target Detection Performance}

I evaluated my system's detection performance using various metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Detection Range}: My system reliably detected targets from 0.5 meters to approximately 30 meters in free space.
    
    \item \textbf{Position Accuracy}: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between estimated and true positions was approximately 3.4 cm for targets within 10 meters.
    
    \item \textbf{Probability of Detection}: With an SNR of 10 dB or higher, my system achieved a detection probability of 93\%.
    
    \item \textbf{False Alarm Rate}: I tuned my CFAR detector to maintain a false alarm rate of approximately $10^{-6}$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Performance in Different Media}

I tested my system's performance with targets behind different materials:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Material} & \textbf{Thickness (cm)} & \textbf{Estimated $\varepsilon_r$} & \textbf{Range Error (\%)} \\
\hline
Air (reference) & - & 1.0 & 0.0 \\
Dry Wall & 1.2 & 2.1 & 3.2 \\
Dry Wood & 2.0 & 1.8 & 2.7 \\
Concrete & 5.0 & 4.5 & 7.5 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{System performance through different materials}
\end{table}

As expected, I observed increased range errors when targets were placed behind materials with higher dielectric constants, due to velocity variations and refraction effects.

\section{Limitations and Challenges}

During my experiments, I encountered several limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Acquisition Speed}: The PocketVNA's relatively slow sampling rate (approximately 10 ms per frequency point) limited real-time applications. A complete 1001-point scan required over 10 seconds.
    
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Range Limitations}: The system achieved approximately 40-70 dB dynamic range (frequency-dependent), which proved adequate for laboratory demonstrations but may be insufficient for longer ranges.
    
    \item \textbf{Resolution/Penetration Trade-off}: The selected frequency band (1600-2500 MHz) balanced resolution and penetration but showed limitations for targets behind high-loss materials.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this project, I successfully implemented a target detection system using a Vector Network Analyzer operating on SFCW principles. My system achieved a practical range resolution of approximately 18 cm, which closely matched the theoretical prediction of 16.7 cm. I demonstrated reliable target detection at various ranges with good accuracy.

Through my experiments, I verified that commercial VNA equipment can be effectively repurposed as a radar system for target detection applications. The PocketVNA's portability and reasonable dynamic range make it a viable option for prototype development and educational purposes.

For future work, I plan to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement advanced clutter rejection algorithms to improve detection in complex environments
    \item Explore multi-band operation to overcome the penetration/resolution trade-off
    \item Develop a real-time processing implementation on FPGA to address the acquisition speed limitations
    \item Test the system in more challenging environments to better characterize its operational limits
\end{itemize}
